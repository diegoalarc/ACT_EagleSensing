Academic Consultancy Project for EagleSensing. Remote Sensing and GIS Integration course, Period 6, 2016-2017.

BACKGROUND:

Sen2Cor is a processor for Sentinel-2 Level 2A product generation and formatting; it performs the atmospheric-, terrain and cirrus correction of Top-Of- Atmosphere Level 1C input data. Sen2Cor creates Bottom-Of-Atmosphere, optionally terrain- and cirrus corrected reflectance images; additional, Aerosol Optical Thickness-, Water Vapor-, Scene Classification Maps and Quality Indicators for cloud and snow probabilities. Its output product format is equivalent to the Level 1C User Product: JPEG 2000 images, three different resolutions, 60, 20 and 10 m.

Sen2Cor should be installed according to the Release Note. After installation, the Sen2Cor processor can be launched from a command line or by integrating the processor in SNAP (as it is described in the chapter 3.2.2 of the Software User Manual).
