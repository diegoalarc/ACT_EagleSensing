## Fmask
Fmask is installed by executing the bash script fmask_install.sh (under ./z_Install_Software/). This 
automatically creates the conda environment "clouddetect", in which all the packages specific for fmask are 
  contained. These packages are listed in fmaskenv_requirements.txt. 
  
Fmask is run by executing the bash script fmask_subprocess.sh (under ./c_Cloud_Detection/). Here, the 
 user must specify the directory in which the Sentinel2 L1C imagery is contained.
 In this bash script, the default output is a single thematic raster in .tif format, but this 
  can be altered by simply changing the extension in the bash file.
