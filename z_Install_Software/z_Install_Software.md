Sen2cor and Sen2three are both officially ESA endorsed third party applications for the processing of Sentinel-2 raster 
datasets. It must be noted that these applications are therefore still under development and require very specific 
installation requirements. Therefore, an installation bundle is included that takes care that all environmental 
variables and installation folders match up. This will ensure that processing with the Sen2Cor and Sen2Three 
applications will run smoothly. 



Instructions:

Step 1: Run the supplied anaconda download script (Anaconda.sh) 

Step 2: Navigate in the terminal to the DL_temp folder (in home directory).

Step 3: Install the Anaconda script with: "bash anaconda.sh".

Step 4: Use defaults by pressing enter throughout the installation instructions.

Step 5: Close all terminal windows to ensure the python environment is anaconda!

Step 6: Run install_software.sh to install Sen2Cor and Sen2Three.

(Step 7: You can install SNAP additionally if you like for manual visual assessments)
